 For this demo a variety of sound signals were recorded in a recording studio at the Center for New Music and Audio Technology (CNMAT). These recordings were 
 converted into digital signals using an  Analog to Digital Converter
 (ADC). Software synthesis programs generated a sound file as their
 output (a sound file  is simply a data 
 file stored on a disk).  After all the samples for a composition are
 calculated the sound file can be played and heard through a Digital to
 Analog Converter (DAC). 
 For the details on how sound can be
 recorded into computer sound files see the 1996 book 
by Curtis Roads, The Computer Music Tutorial
(The MIT Press)
 
 Many different sound file formats exist. The 
 differences between such formats are mainly the rate at
 which the sound signal was sampled and the number of bits per stored
 sample. This information is usually contained in the header of such
 files. The sound files used in this work were sampled at 44.1~kHz and
 used 16-bit words. The particular format used by the SGI computers, at
 CNMAT, is the Audio Interface File Format (aiff). The CNMAT aiff files
 are in stereo 
 (two channels are recorded). For this  work only the
 left channel was 
 used and  for these files the left and right channels were practically
 equal. The aiff sound files used in this work are available via ftp
 from the  <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu">CNMAT server.
