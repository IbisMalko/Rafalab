## Introduction

The unprecedented advancements in digital technology during the second half
of the 20th century has produced a measurement revolution that is
transforming science. For exmple, biomedical research is being 
driven by new technologies that permit us to observe 
molecular entities analogous to identifying microorganisms and other
breakthroughs permitted by the invention of the microscope.

Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data
analysis techniques have been turned on their heads by these
technologies. Interpreting information extracted from these
massive and complex datasets requires sophisticated statistical
methodology as one can easily be fooled by patterns arising by chance
or systematic errors that are hard to detect. 

Rafael Irizarry's lab is interested in the development of
statistical tools that help researchers better interpret their
data. The lab disseminates these tools through open source that is available 
for free online. This software has tens of
thousands of users and the scientific publications in which these
methods are highly cited.

## Joining the Lab

If you are graduating soon with a PhD in Statistics, Biostatistics or Computer
Science and are interested in working with us, consider applying to join
the lab as a postdoctoral fellow. If you are a graduate student at Harvard you should consider
doing a rotation. We don't always have positions available but contacting us is
the most common way that current members have joined the lab.  To succeed in our lab you need to have experience in data
analysis and strong programming skills (we prefer R). Although Professor
Irizarry makes time to meet each trainee weekly and the lab is highly
collaborative, group members are expected to be independent.


If you are applying to grad school and are interested in joining the lab, you need to apply and be accepted to the to the [Biostatistics PhD](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/doctoral-program/) or the [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/big/) programs. Students in this program usually pick an advisor after their first or second year. If the advisor agrees it is a good match the student then becomes an official advisee. This decision is based on the student's performance in their courses or a three month rotation.
Note that Professor Irizarry is not on the admissions committee for either of these PhD programs and he does not decide who is admitted. For specific questions about the program please contact biostat_admissions@hsph.harvard.edu or dms@hms.harvard.edu respectively.
